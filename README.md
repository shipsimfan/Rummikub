# Rummikub
A 3 player rummikub implementation for COMP 4004.

## Tests
Junit tests are used to check game functionality. To run them, create a JUnit 4 run configuration in eclipse containing the tests you wish to run.

After importing, complete the following steps to run:
 1. Start the server
 2. Start three clients
